## General Information

Time series provide useful information about overall economic robustness.Time series can be made using monthly and annual data.The annual data to be used is used according to the working method of the project.This data I will use has been prepared annually by the Ministry of Agriculture.The content of these data indicates the production and consumption amounts of nitrogen fertilizer. I chose it because the nitrogen fertilizer increased productivity in agriculture.

Nitrogen fertilizer  increases the efficiency of productivity in agricultural,so Ä± choose this data. I researched that nitrogen fertilizer production satisfy consumption.This data starts from 1980 and ends in 2019.As a result of the study, it was tried to estimate how many will be produced and consumed in the following years.The aim of this study is whether or not it should be taken from the outside if production is sufficient for consumption,and in order to be sufficient for consumption, it is necessary to work to improve the production.
